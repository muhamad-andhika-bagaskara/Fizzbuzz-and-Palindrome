The following is an explanation of the program that has been made.

#### FizzBuzz
Fizz buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division. Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word 'fizz', and any number divisible by five with the word 'buzz', and any number divisible by both 3 and 5 with the word 'fizzbuzz'. [More on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz).

Palindromes are words, phrases, numbers, or other sequences that can be read the same both forward and backward. [More on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome).
